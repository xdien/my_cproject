About gnuProloadV2.0
=================================
** (This is a general introduction to gnuProload. To read how to
install and use gnuProload, please see INSTALL) **


gnuProloadV2.0 is yet another software to enable you to program the AT89S52
over Linux. 

The reason I created gnuProload, is out of sheer necessity. At one point
of time, I was happily creating AT89S52 programs over windows. I had this
AT89S52 development board from Sunrom Technologies(www.sunrom.com), which was
programmed using an ICSP(In-System Programming Programming) board, also 
by Sunrom Technologies.

The ICSP board,(Sunrom part no. 1001-3470) needed a software called 'Proload'
to program the AT89S52 microcontroller in the development board. 

However, Proload was a pure windows based software which did not have any 
counterpart that ran over Linux.

As a result, for many months my development environment was restricted only
to windows. I really wanted to make use of the wonderful assortment of software
for 8052 based microcontrollers available on Linux. Prime examples would be
the popular SDCC(Small Device C compiler) and asem51(8051 Assembler).

So I decided to make the switch to Linux for all my AT89S52 based projects.
I had everything: asem51/SDCC for assembling/compiling my programs and svn for
revision control. However, I was limited by the lack of a software that would
program the microcontroller for me. Surely rebooting into Linux everytime I
needed to re-program my AT89S52 was not a practical option!

And so gnuProloadV2.0 was born out of this sheer necessity. V2.0 because 
the initial version, V1.0 that I created was a command line version. 
Once the command line version was created I decided to write a GUI version 
of it, using GTK+.

And so here you are, I present to you gnuProloadV2.0!

Another important thing about gnuProloadV2.0 is that, you can not only
use it for programming the AT89S52 development board by Sunrom Technologies
but also for any hardware that is based on the 'Easy-Downloader' developed
by Prof. Wichit Sirichote of the University of Thailand, Bangkok.

In fact, the gnuProload protocol was developed by Prof. Wichit in the beginning.
Sunrom has in fact, re-used it for making their own programmer.

More information about 'Easy-Downloader' can be found at:

Many thanks to Prof. Wichit Sirichote of giving me permission to develop 
gnuProload based on his serial programming protocol.

Also please note that, since I only had the Sunrom hardware I was able to test
gnuProload only with it. In case you are using any other 'Easy-Downloader' compatible
hardware, please try it and let me know if something does not work.
